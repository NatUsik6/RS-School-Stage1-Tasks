Hi everyone! My name is Natali, I’m 22. I’m from Mogilev, Belarus. And I am frontend developer.

I always wanted to be a doctor, so after school I entered the Gomel State Medical University. However in the fourth course I realized that work conditions, requirements, and overall environment are not for me. That’s why I started investigating the IT sphere and I liked development. But there is too much information on the Internet and it’s difficult to choose what you really need.

At that very moment my boyfriend started working as a backend developer. He tried explain me C#, but it was hard for me to understand and imagine how it works.

He showed me EPAM’s training.by website and I saw fronted development course stage 0 from Rolling Scope School. I liked it, because it was free, well organized and logically structured.

Also I liked frontend because you can see your changes immediately after you make them. So I joined this course.

It was hard to combine studying in medical university and learning development. I was getting more and more disappointed in the medical sphere.

As a result I decided to take a serious step - I left the university at the beginning of the fifth course. It was very hard but after that I started a new life.

I successfully finished stage 0, but it was hard to complete stage 1, so I started stage 0 one more time to fill the gaps in my knowledge.

After that I started stage 1 and here I am. I’m pleased that I finished stage 1 and I feel that I gained a lot of knowledge.

Besides learning programming I am studying English and improving my knowledge in it. Currently my English level is Intermediate. 

Now I have such skills as: HTML, CSS (including preprocessors), Git, JS, Algorithms and Data structures, Node.js. I got familiar with Figma, github, VS code, devtools.

At the beginning it was hard for me to understand variables and functions. Although it is very easy for me now. However it’s difficult now to understand classes and prototype as well as OOP principles. But I’m sure that I can do it.

My favorite project is Coffee-House. I like its design and color palette. It was interesting to work with Figma and see how layout becomes alive. I liked making it adaptive and interactive.

It was a big project, so I decided to use preprocessors. It was a very good idea because it helped me reduce the amount of code and improve readability.

The most difficult thing in this project was implementation of the Modal window for selected product on the menu. Because you can choose different additives and sizes - and price depends on what you choose.

In my free time I like to take unusual photos of buildings, nature and objects. In addition I lead an active lifestyle (more walking, riding a bicycle, do sports), like traveling and visiting new places.

Due to assiduity I like to do small, monotonous work and to bring things to an end. I like learning new things and studying.

In the process of studying, I often write notes, structure my studies, write time frames and set deadlines for myself. I have developed empathy, so I can understand people well, how they feel, I understand non-verbal language.

In the future I plan to learn React or Angular, to deepen knowledge in development. After that I am going to try my hand at backend development with Python or Node.JS, and learn mobile development.

As I said I like taking photos, that's why I would like to learn Photoshop and web-design someday.

Thanks for your attention. Bye, have a nice day!
